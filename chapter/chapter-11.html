Why use IOU? - Every time you remember to buy something, just like a shopping list, for example: - When the washing power is reaching its' end - When making a list of groceries for the next BBQ party - Every time you go shopping, consult your IOU lists - Every time you buy something that should be shared with your friends IOU lets you create lists. A list is a container which holds three other lists: - The members of this list - The products you wish to buy - The products bought in this list IOU will keep you informed of how much you spent and based on how your lists are grouped. A list can be closed at any time, simply glance at the members view before closing it to know how much you owe or how much each member owes you. To get started, you must log in using your Facebook, IOU will never share your information with 3rd Parties, neither will it create posts on your behalf. Before login, you must read and accept the terms and conditions: ![Help1](../img/screen_1.png) Unless one of our friends has already added you to an existing list, chances are that your first screen will look blank, the first step is to create a new list, clicking the 'NEW' button in the bottom of the page: ![Help2](../img/screen_2.png) Let's name our list, Households, since it will be a list with items that we share with our housemates. We will also choose the bag icon for this list: ![Help3](../img/screen_3.png) We now have our first list, please note the search box at the top, if we have many lists this feature can come handy to quickly find the list we want. Lets click on it to explore further: ![Help4](../img/screen_4.png) Our list is still empty, we can add a new product by pressing the 'NEW' button in the bottom of the page: ![Help5](../img/screen_5.png) We now have to choose what we want to buy, lets go with potatoes since we are having chips tonight: ![Help6](../img/screen_6.png) Our item now appears in the to buy list, this is much like a shopping list of things we want to buy. Lets go ahead and buy this product within IOU. All we need to do is click on the item itself: ![Help7](../img/screen_7.png) Ok, we can now add the price and press 'BUY': ![Help8](../img/screen_8.png) Our product will now appear in the bought items list, along with its name, price, date bought and a picture of who bought it. Please note that the big gray number at the top of the page still reads '£0.00' despite the fact we have bought an item. That is because we are the only member of our list. If we, want to be the only member of this list and only use it to track personal expenses, we can leave it as it is, however, if we want to split the expenses with others, we have to add new members. Lets click on the members tab: ![Help9](../img/screen_9.png) To create add a new member, simply click on the 'NEW' button at the bottom of the page. Please note that you will only be able to see a list of your Facebook friends that also happen to be members of the IOU app: ![Help10](../img/screen_10.png) Lets choose one of our friends by clicking the 'ADD' button. We can also cancel this action and filter the list, much like in the home page. ![Help11](../img/screen_11.png) Ok, we are now £2.50 positive in our list: ![Help12](../img/screen_12.png) We can always go back to our products page if we want to add a new product or edit a product we bought in the past. Let's edit the product we bought by clicking it: ![Help13](../img/screen_13.png) We can change its name, price and who bought it. Lets go ahead and change the person who bought it by clicking our picture: ![Help14](../img/screen_14.png) We can now only choose those who are members of our list: ![Help15](../img/screen_15.png) Ok, we have successfully reassigned who bought our first product, lets press ok to save the changes: ![Help16](../img/screen_16.png) Please note that we are now £2.50 in debt. We can always navigate back to the home page by pressing the 'HOME' icon at the top left corner of the screen: ![Help17](../img/screen_17.png) Lists can be edited and deleted, those options can be revealed by swiping the list name from right to left: ![Help18](../img/screen_18.png) A quick access menu is also available on all pages: ![Help19](../img/screen_19.png) We hope you enjoy IOU as much as we do.</div></div></div></div></div></div><script src=/js/scripts.1ec7.js></script></body></html>
