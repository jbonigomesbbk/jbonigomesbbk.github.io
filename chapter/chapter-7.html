Each section develops further on what those challenges were and how they were approached.</p><h3>The IOU algorithm</h3><p>The entire application would be meaningless if a good money splitting algorithm was not implemented. It seems money splitting algorithms are somewhat complicated to implement successfully. Moreover, IOU not only aims to split expenses in a fair manner, but also, optimise the change each participant has to pay, so that users do not need to exchange money among each other more than once.</p><p>The first step taken followed Steve Bobs&#39; approach (Stevebob.net, 2015):</p><p>This is only a pseudocode that had to be implemented in JavaScript ensuring that the concept works in a real life scenario.</p><p>The final algorithm can be found in the source code under &#39;app/scripts/services.js&#39; under a factory called MembersWithTotal.</p><p>The algorithm works as follow:</p><div class=highlight><pre><code class=language-text data-lang=text>calculate the list total
calculate how much each individual user spent in the list
calculate the list average by dividing the total per the number of users
calculate how much has been overspent, this is the sum of the difference between the amount of money each member has spent and the list average
qualify the current logged user as a &#39;creditor&#39;, &#39;debtor&#39; or &#39;even&#39;, a user is a &#39;debtor&#39; if he/she spent less than the list average, a &#39;creditor&#39; if he/she spent more and &#39;even&#39; if he/she spent the exact same amount as the list average

if the logged user is a creditor
  for each debtor
    calculate a percentage owed to the current logged in user, this is the percentage of the total overspent that the current logged user has spent
    based on how much the debtor has underspent, calculate how much he/she owes to the current logged user by &#39;slicing&#39; his/her percentage (calculated right above)
    also keep accumulating this number to present as a list overall total

if the logged user is a debtor
  for each creditor
    calculate a percentage the current logged in user owes to the creditor, that is, from the total list overspent, this will be the percentage the creditor has overspent
    based on how much the current logged in user has underspent, calculate how much he/she owes the creditor by &#39;slicing&#39; his/her percentage (calculated right above)
    also keep accumulating this number to present as a list overall total

Otherwise, the logged user must have spent the exact same amount as the list average and therefore does not owe or is owed any money, zero can be returned as the his/her total
</code></pre></div><p>Arriving at this final algorithm required a successive amount of trial and error. Although not particularly elegant, and somewhat naive, after testing with several users, amounts and scenarios, I believe it calculates the totals correctly.</p><p>Following the above, the way the optimised change works is that it will only return one of three scenarios:</p><ul><li>An even list, which means, no actions for the user, he/she spent the ideal amount</li><li>A creditor list, this user does not have to pay any money and is simply informed how much he/she is owed</li><li>A debtor list, this user owes money to the creditors, the app will notify how much is owed to each member</li></ul><p>There is still room for improvement over how this process work, most of which goes towards the efficiency and readability of the JavaScript implementation. Going forward, once the unit tests for this factory have been written, more effort will be applied in its&#39; mathematical foundations.</p><h3>Data architecture</h3><p>Coming from a relational databases background, one of the most difficult mind set to adapt, was to start thinking in a noSQL way.</p><p>In noSQL, data is stored as key value pairs, which in turn, can hold nested key value pairs, in practice, data is represented as a JSON notation object that can be queried by traversing the tree structure.</p><p>The IOU app is powered by, Firebase, an implementation of a noSQL database, that although very fast and scalable comes with a few limitations, for example, it only allows a depth of up to 32 levels when nesting data objects and although data can be queried as arrays, it does not support storing data as arrays, all values must be strictly stored as JSON key value pairs.</p><p>From the Firebase documentation (Firebase.com, 2015), the initial data structure was organised as the sample JSON object below:</p><div class=highlight><pre><code class=language-text data-lang=text>{
  &quot;lists&quot;: {
    &quot;123&quot;: {
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Households&quot;,
      &quot;image&quot;: &quot;lightbulb&quot;,

      &quot;members&quot;: {
        &quot;444&quot; : true,
        &quot;555&quot; : true
      }

      &quot;products&quot;: {
        &quot;567&quot; : true,
        &quot;891&quot; : true
      }
    },

    &quot;234&quot;: { ... },

    &quot;345&quot;: { ... }
  },

  &quot;products&quot;: {
    &quot;567&quot; : {
      &quot;amended&quot; : true,
      &quot;date&quot;    : 1412635438623,
      &quot;name&quot;    : &quot;Potatoes&quot;,
      &quot;owner&quot;   : &quot;444&quot;,
      &quot;price&quot;   : &quot;28&quot;
      &quot;bought&quot;  : true
    },

    &quot;891&quot; : { ... }
  }

  &quot;members&quot;: {
    &quot;444&quot;: {
      &quot;name&quot; : &quot;Jose Gomes&quot; 
    },

    &quot;555&quot;: { ... }
  },
}
</code></pre></div><p>In contrast with a more traditional relational data structures, there is not much going on in the sample above. There are three main collections (lists, products and members) and each hold a series of entries, represented by a unique key which in turn holds the values for that row. The only extraneous notation is how the relations are declared, instead of foreign keys, Firebase recommends setting relations like so:</p><div class=highlight><pre><code class=language-text data-lang=text>&quot;members&quot;: {
  &quot;444&quot; : true,
  &quot;555&quot; : true
}
</code></pre></div><p>This may look intriguing at first, however, since Firebase does not support arrays in their storage, this is the nearest achievable way to represent a one-to-many relation.</p><p>Although easy to understand, this initial set up does not make use of the full potential from a noSQL database, within a key value architecture, the developer is not constrained to the limitations of data normalisation, the database can be moulded in whichever way it best suits the application using it. Besides, joins considerably deteriorate the performance of data processing.</p><p>Based on a blog post by Anant Narayanan (Firebase.com, 2015), the first stage in denormalising the initial concept began to take place:</p><p>In conversation with Sara Robinson, Developer Evangelist at Firebase, during the a Google Developers Conference (Eventbrite, 2015), it became clearer that a more nested structure would boost the application performance yet making it easier to perform queries that return meaningful data with less processing.</p><p>As a result, the second iteration architecturally looks like the following:</p><div class=highlight><pre><code class=language-text data-lang=text>{
  &quot;lists&quot; : {
    &quot;123&quot; : {
      &quot;name&quot;  : &quot;Households&quot;,
      &quot;image&quot; : &quot;lightbulb&quot;,

      &quot;bought&quot; : {
        &quot;567&quot; : {
          &quot;amended&quot; : true,
          &quot;date&quot;    : 1412635438623,
          &quot;name&quot;    : &quot;Potatoes&quot;,
          &quot;owner&quot;   : &quot;444&quot;,
          &quot;price&quot;   : &quot;28&quot;
        },
        &quot;891&quot; : { ... }
      },

      &quot;tobuy&quot; : {
        &quot;678&quot; : {
          &quot;date&quot; : 1412635438623,
          &quot;name&quot; : &quot;Steak&quot;
        },
        &quot;789&quot; : { ... }
      },

      &quot;members&quot;: {
        &quot;444&quot; : true,
        &quot;555&quot; : true
      }
    },

    &quot;234&quot; : { ... },

    &quot;345&quot; : { ... }
  },

  &quot;members&quot; : {
    &quot;444&quot; : {
      &quot;name&quot; : &quot;Jose Gomes&quot;
    },

    &quot;555&quot; : { ... }
  }
}
</code></pre></div><p>Since the IOU app differentiates products that have been bought from products that are still due to be bought, the first step taken was to break down products into two categories (bought and tobuy). This, in turn, raised the awareness that both structures did not have the same attributes. Secondly, since a set of products belong to a list only, much like a one-to-many relationship, it was only natural to nest those two new objects within a list object, those two actions not only improved the speed to which data can be read, but also represent, if not, describe, the IOU app architecture.</p><p>Finally, during the last iteration and after coming to a realisation of how Firebase security rules (Firebase.com, 2015) work, it was decided that a collection of members was not necessary. This decision was made for two reasons, firstly, simply to make the structure cleaner, thus completely avoiding joins and secondly because the objects are too simple, the only data stored is their Facebook id and their names. Besides, if a username is stored in the database, should the user update his/her name on Facebook, IOU will never be notified and will therefore always display an out-of-date username. The final data structure simply removes the members object completely:</p><div class=highlight><pre><code class=language-text data-lang=text>{
  &quot;lists&quot; : {
    &quot;123&quot; : {
      &quot;name&quot;  : &quot;Households&quot;,
      &quot;image&quot; : &quot;lightbulb&quot;,

      &quot;bought&quot; : {
        &quot;567&quot; : {
          &quot;amended&quot; : true,
          &quot;date&quot;    : 1412635438623,
          &quot;name&quot;    : &quot;Potatoes&quot;,
          &quot;owner&quot;   : &quot;444&quot;,
          &quot;price&quot;   : &quot;28&quot;
        },
        &quot;891&quot; : { ... }
      },

      &quot;tobuy&quot; : {
        &quot;678&quot; : {
          &quot;date&quot; : 1412635438623,
          &quot;name&quot; : &quot;Steak&quot;
        },
        &quot;789&quot; : { ... }
      },

      &quot;members&quot;: {
        &quot;444&quot; : true,
        &quot;555&quot; : true
      }
    },

    &quot;234&quot; : { ... },

    &quot;345&quot; : { ... }
  },
}
</code></pre></div><p>This final decision raises one last problem, now every time a use is displayed, an AJAX call must be made to Facebooks&#39; Graph API (Facebook Developers, 2015) in order to return a users&#39; username. Although simplistic, this approach generates a non-obvious problem, when retrieving a list of users of unknown length, we have to wait for all Asynchronous calls to be finished before rendering the list.</p><p>Before going on details, it is important to clarify what a promise (Liskov and Shrira, 1988) is. In Angular.js, most Asynchronous calls are treated as promises, this concept is not new, as mentioned in Wikipedia, the term promise was proposed in 1976 by Daniel P. Friedman and David Wise, and Peter Hibbard called it eventual. However, in the JavaScript world, it&#39;s implementation is still taking &#39;baby steps&#39;. In Angular.js, when a function is meant to return the result of an asynchronous call, an AJAX call for example, this call will be said to return a promise that will be resolved some time in the future. For example, one may wish to stipulate what should be done in the event of an error, or bind the data returned to a model in the event of a successful call.</p><p>Fortunately, Angular provides a service called $q (Docs.angularjs.org, 2015), this service is packed with methods that aid promises handling. This project uses a method of $q called all(). The all() method receives two arguments, the first is an array of promises and the second is a callback function that will be executed when all the promises in the array are resolved, in addition, the data returned by each promise will be packed as an array and passed as an argument to this function. Taking this approach resolved the problem imposed when rendering a list of users, the code sample below has been used the the users:</p><div class=highlight><pre><code class=language-text data-lang=text>// userswithnames refers to an array of promises
// created making sucessive AJAX calls to Facebooks&#39;
// Graph API, based in the stored user ids&#39;
$q.all(userswithnames).then(function(members) {
  // bind each member to the view
});
</code></pre></div><p>In addition, to minimise the number of AJAX calls, since the member that is currently logged in will have his/her data presented throughout most states of the application, during login time IOU will store the users information on Local Storage, hence minimising the usage of $q only to render the members list view.</p><p>Finally, although not closely related with the data structure, getting acquainted with handling asynchronous calls in JavaScript has been paramount to the success of this project. Although Firebase simplifies the data handling with Angular.js by means of using Angularfire, in addition to the $q problem described above, sometimes when data is updated outside the Angular application a new digest loop has to be triggered (East, 2014). This problem has been overcome by setting up a watcher in the root of the Firebase data architecture, every time data changes in Firebase, this watcher is notified and will then run a data refresh within the given controller.</p><h3>oAuth</h3><p>Despite simplifying the entire oAuth process with third parties, Firebase still requires some configuration in order to work as expected.</p><p>Since IOU uses Facebook authentication, the first step is to create a Facebook developer account (Facebook Developers, 2015), then generate a new Facebook app. This process will create an unique Facebook app ID and a secret key. Those two parameters must then be configured accordingly inside Firebase&#39;s admin panel.</p><p>The next step is to choose an appropriate firebase oAuth method, there are several options, however, IOU is constrained to use the authWithOAuthPopup method (Firebase.com, 2015), since it is supported both on all major web browsers and within Cordova&#39;s In-App-Browser (GitHub, 2015) extension.</p><p>The final step is ensure sufficient information about the users is collected from Facebook during the login process. this is done via a scope variable (Firebase.com, 2015), IOU collects the basic public user information, such as the users email address, profile picture and full name, in addition, IOU will also ask permission to have access to the users friends list.</p><p>It is important to note that although IOU has access to the users friends list, Facebook will only return the list of friends of a user that also happen to be an IOU user (Facebook Developers, 2015). This limitation exist to avoid abuses such as spamming, but can, however be quite confusing for a first time Facebook app developer.</p><p>Once all this is in place, Firebase will take care of all the rest, such as token management and providing a consistent API for logging users in and out of the application as well as providing basic information about users and authentication status.</p><h3>Security rules</h3><p>Firebase provides a set of annotations that follow the data structure of the application (Devchat.tv, 2015). In addition to authentication, those annotations dictate who has access to read and write specific sets of data.</p><p>It is important to note that the security rules are not part of the application code, those annotations are set up in the server via Firebase&#39;s admin panel and are therefore not visible even to those who have access to the application source code.</p><p>Once a user is logged in, Firebase will assign a variable named auth, which is null by default, to an object containing the logged user information. Rules can then be written to ensure that a given user does not have access to data he/she should not have access to.</p><p>Much like the Firebase structure, those rules are written in a JSON format and follow the same structure of the Firebase data. For example, in order to control access of a list, so that only users that belong to a list can view and edit it, the following rule may be used:</p><div class=highlight><pre><code class=language-text data-lang=text>{
  &quot;rules&quot;: {
    &quot;.read&quot;: false,
    &quot;.write&quot;: false,
    &quot;lists&quot;: {
      &quot;$list&quot; {
        &quot;.read&quot; : &quot;(root.child(&#39;members/&#39; + auth.uid).val() === auth.uid)&quot;,
        &quot;.write&quot;: &quot;(root.child(&#39;members/&#39; + auth.uid).val() === auth.uid)&quot;,
      }
    }
  }
}
</code></pre></div><p>In order to test security rules, Firebase provides a tool in their admin interface which simulates data reads and writes.</p><p>When developing more complex rules, Firebase has created a tool called Blaze (GitHub, 2015), which compiles Yaml formatted data into workable security rules and allows usage of reusable variables and functions.</p><h3>Play and App stores</h3><p>Last but not least, as opposed to web applications, apps published in the Google Play Store and Apple App Store, must be digitally signed. Each platform operates in a different way, however the principle is the same, the developer generates a key that is used to sign the first version of the application. Subsequent updates to the same will have to be signed with the same key.</p><p>Apple makes this process easier within Xcode, the generated key is automatically added to the developers keychain and the signing process is carried out seamlessly within Xcode (Developer.apple.com, 2015).</p><p>Android has a slightly more complicated process, whereby three steps are necessary when creating the first version of an app (Ionicframework.com, 2015):</p><ul><li><p>Firstly, a key must be generated, replacing &#39;my-release-key&#39; with the desired key name and &#39;alias_name&#39; with the desired alias name:</p><p>$ keytool -genkey -v -keystore my-release-key.keystore -alias alias_name -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000</p></li><li><p>This command will produce a key, and it is the developers&#39; responsibility to keep it safe for future updates, the key generation process will ask several questions about the developers identity and will ask for a password to be created in the end of the process.</p></li><li><p>The next step involves signing the unsigned app with the newly generated key:</p><p>$ jarsigner -verbose -sigalg SHA1withRSA -digestalg SHA1 -keystore my-release-key.keystore HelloWorld-release-unsigned.apk alias_name</p></li><li><p>Finally, the apk that will be uploaded to the Play Store can now be generated:</p><p>$ zipalign -v 4 HelloWorld-release-unsigned.apk HelloWorld.apk</p></li></ul><p>It is worth mentioning that the first step should only be executed once, subsequent updates will then reused the key for the jarsigner before it can be zipaligned. Failure to provide the same key will block the app from being updated.</p><p>Also, when deploying updates to the Play and App Stores, one must remember to increase the version number in the config.xml file, located in the root of the project structure (Ionic, 2015).</p></div></div></div></div></div><script src=/js/scripts.1ec7.js></script></body></html>
