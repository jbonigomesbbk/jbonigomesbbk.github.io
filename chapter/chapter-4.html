In summary, all apps do not diverge from the original source code, they have simply been compiled for different platforms.</p><p>Unfortunately, by the time of this writing, the iOS application is still under approval by Apple, please keep on checking the live version of this documentation at the link below as it will be made available as soon as the app goes live:</p><p><a href=http://iou.rocks>http://iou.rocks</a></p><p>The Android application can be downloaded and installed from the link below:</p><p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jbonigomes.IOU">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jbonigomes.IOU</a></p><p>A web version of the application has also been made available at the following link:</p><p><a href=https://ioutest.firebaseapp.com>https://ioutest.firebaseapp.com</a></p><p>It is important to note that since the codebase for the web app and the mobile apps are the same, a greater amount of care has been taken towards the mobile apps, and therefore, the web application lacks a slight level of completeness. The main issue lies within the fact that page refreshes may render the application unusable, should that occur, one must click the home button at the top left corner of the screen then trigger another browser refresh. This issue has been added to the backlog and once the web app is deemed to be sufficiently good for full usage it will be published in a new URL that does not contain the word &#39;test&#39; in it.</p><p>Chapter 6 develops further towards what is recommended for future improvements, however, an archiving system that was originally planned could not be implemented yet. This has however been added to the backlog and will be developed in a future version. This decision was based applying the MoSCoW priorisation method (Bennett, McRobb and Farmer, 2010), to cover the lack of an archiving system, for now, users have the option to completely delete a list. IOU recommends to only delete a list once all members are satisfied that the amount owed to each other meets their expectancy, once a list has been deleted, it can no longer be retrieved.</p><h2>Information Architecture</h2><p>The information architecture for IOU takes in consideration the overall user experience aiming to logically group sections that relate to each other and layer them down based on importance.</p><p><img src=../img/information_architecture.efec.png alt=Fig7> <em>Fig 7 - Information architecture</em></p><p>Although not explicitly demonstrated, all states that require login present a link that goes straight back to the home page as well as a quick access slide menu that displays information about the currently logged user and present links to the home page, privacy page, terms and conditions page and logout.</p><h2>Angular Architecture</h2><p>The application dependencies look like the following diagram:</p><p><img src=../img/angular_architecture.79b5.png alt=Fig8> <em>Fig 8 - Angular architecture</em></p><p>Centrally located is the IOU module, where the applications&#39; run method is located, this module declares the external and internal dependencies that together form the final product.</p><h2>Use cases</h2><p>In addition to the information architecture depicted above, this section develops further into the user journey analysing each scenario a user may encounter.</p><p>The use case diagrams below assumes that &#39;Common Links&#39; refers to the following links:</p><ul><li>Home page</li><li>Terms and Conditions page</li><li>Privacy Policy page</li></ul><p>Also, the diagrams do not explicitly show that for every stage that requires a login, a logout link is also provided.</p><p>Before having access to the application, the user must first accept the terms and conditions and login.</p><p><img src=../img/use_login.da0c.png alt=Fig9> <em>Fig 9 - Login Use Case</em></p><p>The home page shows all lists that the current logged user belongs to. Allows creating, editing, deleting and filtering lists. Each list also displays their total in relation to the logged user. The top of the page should give a summary of the whole total between all lists in relation to the currently logged in user.</p><p><img src=../img/use_home.8441.png alt=Fig10> <em>Fig 10 - Home Use Case</em></p><p>The products view should display a list of all products that are due to be bought as well as all the products that have been bought. It should allow creating new products, buying products and editing products. It should also display a total for the current list in relation to the logged in user.</p><p><img src=../img/use_products.f23f.png alt=Fig11> <em>Fig 11 - Products Use Case</em></p><p>The members view should show all members that belong to the current list. Each member should be displayed with a calculated field of how much they owe or are owed in relation to the currently logged in user. The same list overall total that appears in the products page should be displayed at the top of the members page too. From the members view, new members could also be added.</p><p><img src=../img/use_members.b6ac.png alt=Fig12> <em>Fig 12 - Members Use Case</em></p><p>The user workflow for using the IOU app should look like the following:</p><ul><li>When a user remembers that something has to be bought, a new item should be created in the products view.</li><li>When this newly created product is bought in the &#39;real world&#39;, the user should &#39;buy&#39; this product within IOU, by means of adding a price to the given product.</li><li>Once all members decide it is time to close the list, they should check the members tab to know how much they owe each other.</li><li>Finally, in the &#39;real world&#39; they should exchange the proposed amounts then delete the list from IOU.</li></ul><h2>Application Structure</h2><p>The following is the file structure powering IOUs&#39; source code, this is the default structure created by Diego Nettos&#39; Yeoman Generator:</p><div class=highlight><pre><code class=language-text data-lang=text>├── Gruntfile.js        - Configuration of all Grunt tasks
