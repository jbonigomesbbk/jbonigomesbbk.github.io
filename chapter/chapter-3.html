Each list will also have a name and an icon associated to them. Both of which are editable. A list can only be viewed, edited or closed by their members.</p><p>Once a product is added to a list, it should be treated as an item that is still due to be bought. Any user from any given list can &#39;buy&#39; those products. Adding or editing the price and name of any product, both bought and due to be bought, can be done at any time. There should be a timestamp for each bought product that has been edited, staing the last time it was edited, any bought product that has been edited should display this timestamp.</p><p>Every list should also have a members view, where more members can be added and it should clearly state the breakdown of how much each member owes or is owed in relation to the user currently logged in.</p><p>The main list view should display the current user overall balance, that is, taking into account all lists he/she belongs to. Within the single list views, the overall balanced presented should be constrained to the current list.</p><p>The Login page, Terms and conditions of usage an Privacy Policy pages should be open to the public, however, all other pages should be private.</p><p>A left navigation menu should be present on all private pages, showing the picture and name of who is logged in as well as links to the home view, the terms and conditions view, the privacy policy view and a logout feature, that should clear all local storage data, logout the user and redirect to the login page.</p><p>A go home button should be present on all screens to aid navigation.</p><p>The main action of each page should be presented in a block button in the bottom of each page.</p><h3>The backend technology choices</h3><p>There is no doubt that to achieve it, data should be provided by means of a Web Service Restful API, where the endpoints expose data in a convinient JSON format to be consumed by either a native moblie application or from a web application running on a browser. However, the options on how to implent such structure are endless. Below is a list of the choices and the rationale behind them:</p><ul><li><p>PHP backend using Laravel:</p><ul><li>Pros: This would&#39;ve been the easiest solution, Laravel is a very flexible framework that provides powerful and yet simple to use features. It&#39;s routing system could easily cater for the nescessities of IOU, queues are easy to integrate and packages such as socialite can take care of the Facebook authentication.</li><li>Cons: Although there is a possibility to use other databases, MySQL is still the predominant option within the PHP world. Websockets are rather difficult to integrate. Even though HHVM can compile PHP code to C, it still lacks the extra speed boost nescessary for a real time app.</li></ul></li><li><p>Node.js:</p><ul><li>Pros: Works really well with noSQL databases and websockets. Frameworks like Sails make it really easy to create and expose a Restful API and it performs quite well in terms of speed.</li><li>Cons: Not as easy as with PHP to find a suitable free server to start the work.</li></ul></li><li><p>Firebase:</p><ul><li>Pros: No need to write an API, store your data on Firebase, set up your security rules and you are ready to go. Full support for websockets and Facebook integration. Fast speed from noSQL databases and the entry plan is free of charge.</li><li>Cons: If you want to process anything other than data, such as images and payment, you will still need a backend system other than Firebase. As your application expands plans become more expensive.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>The frontend technology choices</h3><p>For the frontend app, the choices were more limited, that is, in order to run a native application on a phone, one must develop constrained to the architecture he/she is writting if for. For example, Java is the native environment for Android apps and iOS developers have a choice between Swift and Objective-C.</p><p>Another option was to create a hybrid phone application, that is, write it using common web application technologies such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript, then compile it using either PhoneGap or Apache Cordova to run in an in-app browser. As a side note, PhoneGap is a branch from the open source project Apache Cordova administered by Adobe.</p><p>The last option was to use Titanium AppCelerator, which sits somewhere in between a native and a hybrid application, Titanium exposes a JavaScript API and converts them to the native function calls to the target architecture on compiling time.</p><p>Despite having to choose which is frontend technology is best suited for IOU, one more element had to be considered. That is, the addition of a framework that would allow faster development and provide amenites such as high level abstractions for the platform and testing facilities. This is specially important, since the app has to run on more than one platform, including web.</p><p>At this point, the idea of using either a native application solution or Titanium, were begining to fade, native apps would be constrained to one architecture only and therefore, have to be re-developed for every other platform I would want to have it deployed to. Titanium, solves that problem, but falls short if you want to deploy your app to the web. Not to mention a rather cryptic API.</p><p>That&#39;s when I came across Ionic, Ionic is a frontend SDK for developing hybrid mobile apps. Framewoks such as Lungo and Topcoat, do cover part of what Ionic does, that is, they provide consistent widgets that can be used interchangeably throughout different platforms. However, Ionic goes the extra mile, not only providing frontend widgets, but also exposing and API that wraps Apache Cordova and a tight integration with Angular.js, making it the ultimate production tool when the subject comes to developing hybrid phone applications.</p><h3>The decisions</h3><p>The final choice was to stick to Ionic for the frontend and Firebase for the backend.</p><p>The main rationale behind this decision was how both technologies combine and complement each other. Firebase provides a driver that integrates with Angular.js, converting it into a true 3-way data binding tool.</p><p>Angular.js is a tool backed up by Google which aims to structure JavaScript apps and impulse the development of applications that otherwise would be impossible to develop or to the very least take too long.</p><p>Besides, Angular&#39;s Eco System boasts a vibrant community, integration with Node.js workflow tools such as yeoman, bower and grunt are a breeze, E2E and Unit testing tools options are vast and Directives trully extend the vocabulary of HTML.</p><p>It still falls short in a sense that the application is not native, that is, some of the transition effects may not be as smooth as those provided natively and despite Firebase being a really interesting backend solution, in future, if the app needs to consume more powerfull features, such as image resize and integration with a payment gateway, Firebase will not sufice.</p><p>Nevertheless, the combination of those tools have been proven to be right for IOU, future improvements will dictate what other technologies will be used.</p><p>The diagram below represents the communication between the clients and the server. Every request that goes to Firebase must first satisfy the security rules. The double arrows represent the websockets:</p><p><img src=../img/sockets.b169.png alt=Fig1> <em>Fig 1 - Websockets architecture</em></p><h3>The newer technologies</h3><p>After the technologies that were used in this project were decided, a two notable alternatives arised, although not nescessarily a better option, exploring the following will be essential in future implentation decisions:</p><ul><li><p>React.js: This is a library created and maintaned by Facebook, as oposed to Angular.js, which uses HTML as its&#39; templating language, React relies on a virtual DOM, that is, an abstraction of the DOM is created within JavaScript, allowing the app to to update the views in real time, without the nescessity of triggering an expensive digest loop. This in turn seems to resolve the issue some of the Ionic apps suffer from in terms of slow DOM updates that make the app look and feel sluggish.</p></li><li><p>Monaca: This is a paid framework, that has a limited features version available free of charge. Much like Ionic, Monaca uses Angular.js to power the application API and seems to have the same features as Ionic, the only plus side being that it integrates Crosswalk in all apps by default. Crosswalk is the latest Chromium version, which renders animations much more gracefully than the default Android Web View. Of course, Ionic apps can also be packaged with Crosswalk, but it does not come free of cofiguration overhead.</p></li></ul><h2>The workflow</h2><p>Now that the technologies have been chosen, an efficient workflow must be devised in order to maximize production and generate good quality builds. Below is a non exhaustive list of the technologies used for this application:</p><ul><li>Git<ul><li>Git-Flow</li></ul></li><li>Node.js<ul><li>Cordova</li><li>Yeoman</li><li>generator-ionic</li><li>Bower</li><li>Angular</li><li>Angular Animate</li><li>Angular Local Storage</li><li>Angular UI Router</li><li>Firebase</li><li>Angularfire</li><li>Ionic</li><li>Firebase</li><li>ngCordova</li><li>Grunt</li><li>autoprefixer</li><li>contrib-compass</li><li>contrib-concat</li><li>contrib-cssmin</li><li>contrib-htmlmin</li><li>contrib-jshint</li><li>contrib-uglify</li><li>contrib-watch</li><li>ng-annotate</li><li>ng-constant</li><li>usemin</li><li>wiredep</li><li>stylish</li></ul></li><li>Ruby Gems<ul><li>SASS</li><li>Compass</li></ul></li><li>Android SDK</li><li>iOS SDK</li></ul><p>In addition, the cordova inappbrowser plugin has also been installed for both Android and iOS platforms in order to aid Facebook oAuth login with Firebase.</p><h3>Git and Git-Flow</h3><p>Git has been the version control system of choice for this assignment. Git, originaly created by Linus Torvalds, despite being relatively new, is now a mature tool that as opposed to more conservative VCSs&#39; takes a distributed approach. Withough getting in too much detail, what it really means is that branches are &#39;cheap&#39; to create, there is no need to deploy every branch to the remote repository, every developer keeps the relevant branches to himself in his local repository. Nevertheless, in practice, it is a good idea to have one central repository to keep track of the projects&#39; progress, for this assignment, GitHub has been chosen as the origin.</p><p>In addition, in order to keep a reasonable workflow, this assignment adheres to git flow guidelines. Originally a blog post by Vincent Driessen:</p><p><img src=../img/gitflow.9898.png alt=Fig1> <em>Fig 1 - Gitflow workflow</em></p><p>Although not direcly relevant for this project, as it has been developed by only one person, Git flow provides a mean to keep the repository organised ensuring different developers can collaborate in different points of a project lifecycle. Shoulds this project every expand into a bigger application, new developers will be able to collaborate immediately, withough too much overhead. The main selling point for implementing git flow, is this instance, was so that commits happen in appropriate branches and that releases and hotfixes are tagged appropriately. To ensure that the branching model follows the workflow correctly, Vincent has written a Git plugin that facilitates adherence to his proposed model. It can be found in the repository below:</p><p><a href=https://github.com/nvie/gitflow>https://github.com/nvie/gitflow</a></p><p>This project uses the above plugin and adheres to Vincets&#39; model.</p><h3>Node.js</h3><p>Despite being originally a backend tool, it&#39;s powerfull package manager (NPM), has now been proven to be an exelent tool to manage any JavaScript project, being it a backend, frontend or hybrid application. Since this assignment relies on Firebase as the backend technology, Node.js has been used to manage the frontend assets.</p><p>In a nutshell, three tools were used:</p><ul><li><p>Yeoman: Used to scaffold the app, Yeoman is an scaffolding tool, created and maintained by Google, whereby developers can share their workflow with others. The generator used for this application was created by Diego Netto, his generator is recommended by the creators of Ionic, the framework of choice for this assignment.</p></li><li><p>Bower: Bower is being used to manage the frontend CSS and JavaScript assets. It takes care of all dependencies allowing the Git repository to be slimer, since the dependencies do not need to make part of it. Furthermore, this project uses Wiredep, a Grunt task that trigger everytime a new bower depency is added. And automatically injects the dependency within Usemin blocks. Of course, there is a chance this process may fail, since not all bower dependencies are developed in a way that Wiredep understands, howerver, as a rule of thumb, all bower dependencies must be added using the <code>--save</code> flag, for example:</p><p>$ bower install bootstrap --save</p><ul><li>Since we used the save flag, our bower.json should now contain a new entry, in this case &#39;bootstrap&#39; and &#39;jQuery&#39; (Bootstraps&#39; dependency), and since bower.json has changed, our watcher must have triggered Wiredep, which in turn must have added the dependencies to our index.html. This brings us to the second rule of thumb, one must always check that Wiredep has added the dependency appropriately in the HTML file.</li></ul></li><li><p>Grunt: Grunt is used as the overall manager for all the tasks running. Several watchers are running simultaneous and a complex build process is happening involving concatenating, obfuscating and minifying code. All this adds up to less HTTP requests for the final application and a more &#39;machine ready&#39; production code. In order to keep up with a good coding style, a JSLint task has also been incorporated and runs every time a JavaScript file is modified, it runs a series of strict checks and outputs its&#39; results within the Grunt-CLI. The heuristic for this JSLint to carry out the most strict checks is to ensure all JavaScript files start with a &#39;use strict&#39; declaration.</p></li></ul><h3>Angular js</h3><p>Developed and maintained by Google, Angular adds several advantages to the development process of JavaScript applications. The four main points to mention are:</p><ul><li><p>Two way data binding: Angular has models that pieces of data that are binded to the view via a $scope. Every time a model changes its value, the view is updated. This reflects into shorter code that does not rely on DOM structure and manipulation. Freeing the developer to concentrate in the applications&#39; logic rather than its&#39; formatting.</p></li><li><p>Directives: When DOM manipulaton is absolutely nescessary, Angular provides directives, whereby developers can write reusable pieces of code that will operate in a set data in combination with a DOM structure. Throughout this application, a reusable directive has been used to cater for the search features.</p></li><li><p>Structure: Angular adds structure to an application. Although commonly followin an MVC architecture, Angular calls itself an MVW framework, which literally stands for Mode-View-Whatever, it lays out the guidelines, but leaves it up to the developer on how to best implement them. All applications typically have an entry point, called the run method; Templates can be decorated with directives and expressions, further DOM manipulation can be encapsulated within reusable Directives; Shared functionality can be created as services, which in turn can be configured during different points of the applications&#39; lifecycle; Code behind view blocks can be stored in controllers; application state can be managed via routes, filters provide formatting and filtering functionality; And it can all be grouped within modules, which are very similar to namespaces, other than modules will also declare their external dependencies.</p></li><li><p>Dependency Injection: As mentioned by Brian Ford in a Google developer conference, depency injection can be defined with one sentence: &quot;Dont&#39; call me, I&#39;ll call you&quot;. What he means is that it is a design pattern that implements inversion of control, one of the SOLID principles. Instead of instantiating objects within our methods, we simply declare the dependencies in our methods&#39; signature, Angular will recognise the services a module depends on and will automatically inject the correct intantiated objects when that method is called during run time. This makes the methods more testable and more decoupled from one another, hence, immediately providing higher adeherence to SOLID principles.</p></li></ul><p>In addition, this application makes use of an Angular service called Angular Local Storage, this depency provides a simple API to interact with HTML5 local storage for different clients. It will also fall back to cookies, should Local Storage not be available in the current system.</p><h3>Ionic and Cordova</h3><p>In the core of this entire application is Ionic, a Framework for building hybrid (native/web) applications for smart devices (phones/tablets). Finding and deciding on using Ionic was the single most labourious research for this project.</p><p>Prototypes were written using different approaches, in fact, most would either only have a set of UI interfaces or provide the low level integration required with Cordova, such as Topcoat and the Angular-Cordova bridge respectively. Nonetheless, Ionic that provided all the nescessary tools and workflow to accomplish the final task in one framework.</p><p>Being backed by Drifty Co. a company that works closely with Google, and having their CEO, Max Lynch, writting the Angular.js port for Material Design, places Ionic in a very respectable position.</p><p>Despite all that, Ionic disponibilises ngCordova a tool that seamlesly integrates Angular.js with Apache Cordova, making it easy to call the low level Cordova API without compromising on the application architecture.</p><p>It also provides a beautiful set of predefined UI elements and Directives that package them together for advance usage. Plus, Angular-UI-Router is already packaged in the bundle, so nested routes and states can also be implemented.</p><p>In addition, Ionic keeps an up-to-date forum and documentation, not to mention a nightly built code sample library on Code-Pen.</p><p>Ionic has also recently released a service called Ionic View, which allows developers to view and share their application on different mobile platforms without going through the hassle of deploying their app in any app store. And will soon release a push notification system, now closing the loop with all nescessary services to develop complex hybrid mobile applications.</p><h3>Firebase</h3><p>Combining noSQL with a layer of websockets, comes Firebase, it is not only a database system in the cloud but also a full eco system that caters for security anotations on top of your data structure and oAuth integration with providers such as Facebook and Google+. This project integrates Firebase by means of a library called Angularfire. Angularfire is a library written by the Firebase team that aids easier integration with Angular, converting the application into a Three way data binding tool, when data changes in the database the view for all clients is immediately updated, real-time. Combining a top notch support team and being now part of Google, Firebase will soon become one of the biggest entities for a backend solution.</p><h3>SASS/Compass</h3><p>This projects makes use of CSS pre-processors in order to simplify the stylesheets nescessary to render the application. A Grunt tasks then aids it further, by means of running the compass watch task nescessary to transform the SASS code into CSS. It also makes use of another task called Autoprefixer, which in turn prefixes CSS3 declarations with the browser vendors anottations. For example, as a developer, I may wish to use border radius for my buttons, my css class may look like the following:</p><div class=highlight><pre><code class=language-text data-lang=text>.btn {
  border-radius: 5px;
}
</code></pre></div><p>After running Autoprefixer, the browser vendors will be added like so:</p><div class=highlight><pre><code class=language-text data-lang=text>.btn {
  -webkit-border-radius: 5px;
     -moz-border-radius: 5px;
          border-radius: 5px;
}
</code></pre></div><p>This process has runs automatically whenever a SASS file is changed throught the application.</p><p>In addition, Compass provides a full library of Mixins, aiding further with common CSS patterns.</p><h3>The SDKs&#39;</h3><p>the fact that a mac is needed to create iOS apps and the steps to get the Android SDK to work (ant, java, etc...) Finally, to develop a mobile application, one has to make use of the SDKs&#39; for the given platform. This can be cumbersome at first to set up and configure.</p><p>Firstly, in order to develop an iOS application, one must be developing on a Macintosh computer, this is nescessary since the SDKs&#39; come bundled with XCode a Mac specifc application. Providing you are on a Mac, the set up for iOS is rather simplistic, one only needs to download and install XCode, accept the terms and conditions and ensure the command line tools are installed and available.</p><p>In the other hand, the Android SDK can be proven to be slightly more difficult. The first dependency to be installed is the Java JDK, almost all the other dependencies can be met by means of installing the Android Studio, an excelent IDE built on top of the JetBrains IntelliJ. However, if you wish to develop in the terminal there are a few other things that must be made available on your path:</p><ul><li>The SDK platform-tools</li><li>The JAVA_HOME variable</li><li>Ant</li><li>ADB (The Adroid Debug Bridge)</li></ul><p>With all that in place, Android development should be possible, however, if that seems like too much overhead, Ionic disponibilises a Vagrant box that can be obtained from the link below:</p><p><a href=https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-box>https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-box</a></p><p>Vagrant is a Virtual Machines manager that integrates with Oracles Virtual Box. Both tools are available free of charge.</p></div></div></div><script src=/js/scripts.df94.js></script></body></html>
