Each list will also have a name and an icon associated to them. Both of which are editable. A list can only be viewed, edited or closed by their members.</p><p>Once a product is added to a list, it should be treated as an item that is still due to be bought. Any user from any given list can &#39;buy&#39; those products. Adding or editing the price and name of any product, both bought and due to be bought, can be done at any time. There should be a timestamp for each bought product that has been edited, staing the last time it was edited, any bought product that has been edited should display this timestamp.</p><p>Every list should also have a members view, where more members can be added and it should clearly state the breakdown of how much each member owes or is owed in relation to the user currently logged in.</p><p>The main list view should display the current user overall balance, that is, taking into account all lists he/she belongs to. Within the single list views, the overall balanced presented should be constrained to the current list.</p><p>The Login page, Terms and conditions of usage an Privacy Policy pages should be open to the public, however, all other pages should be private.</p><p>A left navigation menu should be present on all private pages, showing the picture and name of who is logged in as well as links to the home view, the terms and conditions view, the privacy policy view and a logout feature, that should clear all local storage data, logout the user and redirect to the login page.</p><p>A go home button should be present on all screens to aid navigation.</p><p>The main action of each page should be presented in a block button in the bottom of each page.</p><h3>The backend technology choices</h3><p>There is no doubt that to achieve it, data should be provided by means of a Web Service Restful API, where the endpoints expose data in a convinient JSON format to be consumed by either a native moblie application or from a web application running on a browser. However, the options on how to implent such structure are endless. Below is a list of the choices and the rationale behind them:</p><ul><li><p>PHP backend using Laravel:</p><ul><li>Pros: This would&#39;ve been the easiest solution, Laravel is a very flexible framework that provides powerful and yet simple to use features. It&#39;s routing system could easily cater for the nescessities of IOU, queues are easy to integrate and packages such as socialite can take care of the Facebook authentication.</li><li>Cons: Although there is a possibility to use other databases, MySQL is still the predominant option within the PHP world. Websockets are rather difficult to integrate. Even though HHVM can compile PHP code to C, it still lacks the extra speed boost nescessary for a real time app.</li></ul></li><li><p>Node.js:</p><ul><li>Pros: Works really well with noSQL databases and websockets. Frameworks like Sails make it really easy to create and expose a Restful API and it performs quite well in terms of speed.</li><li>Cons: Not as easy as with PHP to find a suitable free server to start the work.</li></ul></li><li><p>Firebase:</p><ul><li>Pros: No need to write an API, store your data on Firebase, set up your security rules and you are ready to go. Full support for websockets and Facebook integration. Fast speed from noSQL databases and the entry plan is free of charge.</li><li>Cons: If you want to process anything other than data, such as images and payment, you will still need a backend system other than Firebase. As your application expands plans become more expensive.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>The frontend technology choices</h3><p>For the frontend app, the choices were more limited, that is, in order to run a native application on a phone, one must develop constrained to the architecture he/she is writting if for. For example, Java is the native environment for Android apps and iOS developers have a choice between Swift and Objective-C.</p><p>Another option was to create a hybrid phone application, that is, write it using common web application technologies such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript, then compile it using either PhoneGap or Apache Cordova to run in an in-app browser. As a side note, PhoneGap is a branch from the open source project Apache Cordova administered by Adobe.</p><p>The last option was to use Titanium AppCelerator, which sits somewhere in between a native and a hybrid application, Titanium exposes a JavaScript API and converts them to the native function calls on compiling time.</p><h2>The decisions</h2></div></div></div><script src=/js/scripts.df94.js></script></body></html>
